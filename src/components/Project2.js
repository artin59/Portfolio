        <p>I chose my mock interview because it perfectly showcases my communication skills. It allowed me to demonstrate my verbal communication, my ability to think fast on my feet in a professional context. Interviews are really stressful things, but the more you practice them the better you get at conveying your thoughts in a professional tone. During the preparation portion of the interview after each attempt I got better at improving my pacing, body language and also the contents of my answers. This assignment definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone. Speaking to a screen felt awkward and nerve-wracking at first, also because I wasnâ€™t talking to a real person, it was hard to gauge how I was doing. But after multiple practice attempts, I got more comfortable and confident to proceed with the actual interview. I think I did a very good job at understanding the questions I was asked, and relating them to my experiences in the short amount of time that I was given. In a real interview I would only have a fraction of that time to prepare a well thought out answer, so there is definitely room for improvement.
